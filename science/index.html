	  Science! Science is a pretty cool topic that has many interesting things and can have some very fun categories you can research further upon including: Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Computer Science, and a lot more! Personally I really enjoy Chemistry and Physics as well.
	  I have done Science Bowl, read about sciences and have watched interesting videos as well. Sometimes it can get a little tidious, but overall can be very fun and very useful.
	  I started kind of enjoying science from 5th grade and then started to enjoy it more up until now.
